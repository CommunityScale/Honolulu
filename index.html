				<p>Honolulu has launched a planning process to understand the local housing landscape and develop strategies and solutions that help meet current and projected needs across income levels. As a first step, Honolulu commissioned a housing study to gauge housing supply and demand across the county. This summer, Honolulu begins extensive community engagement to share findings from the study and promote ideas and recommendations that can help Honolulu County communities expand the housing supply to better meet the needs of local residents.

Other communities have amended their zoning over the years to permit a greater variety of housing options and development models in keeping with evolving need and demand. The most immediate and effective way to unlock opportunities for new housing production is to update local zoning codes to enable a wider range of housing types, such as tiny houses, duplexes, multifamily, mixed-use, adaptive reuse, ADUs and other models better aligned with local needs.</p>
