				<h3>The challenge</h3>
				<h5>The shortage of affordable housing on O'ahu is a long-standing, complex issue that the city has faced for decades. </h5>
				<p>The lack of housing impacts us as a community. Increasing the supply of housing for all income levels must be considered, as a continuum of need exists, ranging from homeless shelters and permanent supportive housing, to low-income rentals, workforce housing, and single-family homes and condos for those pursuing the American dream of homeownership.</p>

				<h3>The purpose of this plan</h3>
				<h5>This document builds on the the Office of Housing’s 2023 Housing Plan with extensive data analysis, stakeholder engagement, policy review, and actionable recommendations to help the City and County of Honolulu achieve its housing goals through 2029 and beyond. </h5>
				<p> This plan is intended to help stakeholders and residents understand the details and nuances of the city’s housing challenge, coordinating with other City departments and governing datasets and metrics to provide a strategic roadmap to unlock opportunities for expanded housing production across the spectrum of affordability - and especially among income levels that have been underserved by current policies and market activity.

Other communities have amended their zoning over the years to permit a greater variety of housing options and development models in keeping with evolving need and demand. The most immediate and effective way to unlock opportunities for new housing production is to update local zoning codes to enable a wider range of housing types, such as tiny houses, duplexes, multifamily, mixed-use, adaptive reuse, ADUs and other models better aligned with local needs.</p>
